## Project Overview

A production-ready churn analytics solution that helps telecom companies identify at-risk customers, quantify revenue impact, and prioritize retention efforts using machine learning.

Built with modern data science tools to demonstrate end-to-end analytics capabilities: from raw data ingestion through interactive business intelligence dashboards.

**The Problem:** High customer churn (26.5%) threatens recurring revenue. Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retention.

**The Solution:** ML-powered dashboard that segments 7,000+ customers by churn risk and provides actionable insights for targeted intervention.

**The Impact:** 
â€¢ 89% AUC model accuracy 
â€¢ $128K monthly revenue at risk identified 
â€¢ 25% churn reduction potential

## Results

### Model Performance
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| ROC-AUC | 0.89 |
| Precision | 0.71 |
| Recall | 0.61 |
| F1-Score | 0.66 |

### Key Insights
1. **Contract type** is the strongest churn predictor
2. **Month-to-month customers** have 3-5x higher churn risk
3. **First 6 months** are the critical vulnerability period
4. **High monthly charges** correlate with increased churn

### Business Impact
- ðŸŽ¯ 1,625 high-risk customers flagged for immediate intervention
- ðŸ’° $128K/month revenue exposure quantified
- ðŸ“Š 25% churn reduction = $385K annual revenue saved
